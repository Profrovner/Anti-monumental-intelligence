"Date: 1926
Artist: MacNeil, Herman Atkins, 1866-1947, sculptor, with assistance by Holabird and Roche.
Location: 24th Street and Marshall Boulevard, Pilsen, Chicago
Commission: B.F. Ferguson Monument Fund"

"The Jacques Marquette-Louis Jolliet Memorial commemorates French missionary explorers, depicted alongside a subservient Indigenous guide. Marquette and Jolliet are known for their exploration and charting of the Mississippi River, en route to finding the Northwest Passage at the Great Lakes. The passage was instrumental to the French colonial ability to send furs extracted from animals of the North American continent back to France for sale in the open market. The monument reflects the hierarchical power dynamics of the settler colonial project, reinforcing the narrative of European missionaries as civilizing saviors to "savage Indians". Positioned in Pilsen, a predominantly Latino neighborhood, and across from Maria Saucedo Scholastic Academy—named after a Latina activist who championed Latino rights to education, housing, and resources—the monument starkly contrasts with the legacy of displacement faced by non-White communities. It evokes the historical patterns of erasure and marginalization in the making of the so-called "progressive" city, tying settler colonization to ongoing struggles for equity and justice."

"Under each figure in the monument, the names 'Illinois,' 'Jacques Marquette,' and 'Louis Jolliet' are inscribed, respectively. By neglecting to name or give an identity to the Indigenous figure separate from that of the land, the engraving contributes to harmful portrayals of Indigenous peoples as savage, silent, or of a bygone era."

"Note the buffalo and elk depicted in the lands adjacent to the river, the overstated scale of which reflect the French interest in the fur trade."

"The towering scale and forward positioning of the central figure, Marquette, highlights his power, further symbolized by his holding of a cross in the left hand, and his outreached hand to the right. The Indian guide is depicted in a slouched position, cowering below Marquette, yet gazing up to him as if to ask for guidance himself. This role reversal allows the viewer to see Marquette as the guide, when in fact, the French were foreign to these lands, beholden to the knowledge of Indigenous tribes who had navigated and cultivated them for centuries."

#### Arguments For Preservation
- Some defenders of the monument suggest that the “journeys” of Marquette and Jolliet were crucial to the foundation of Chicago and do not see the monument as problematic at all
- [Ruberry, John. “Chicago Monuments under Assault, Part 16: Marquette and Jolliet.” Web log. Marathon Pundit (blog), 2021](https://marathonpundit.blogspot.com/2021/03/chicago-monuments-under-assault-part-16.html#google_vignette.)
- The Chicago Tribune published the opinions of some of their readers that wrote in concerning the monument. One individual wrote that they, as a white person, do not feel any empowerment when they see the memorial, and see it rather as a sad reminder of the way Indigenous people were treated. Another reader wrote that they see the monument as a celebration of shared cultures, and that the monument is “demeaning to no one.”

- Others, such individuals at the Hermon A. MacNeil Virtual Gallery hold a similar importance to the history behind the monument. One commenter on the website’s article about the potential removal of the monument announced that they had “written to newspapers, TV outlets and friends” in an effort to preserve the statue.

#### Arguments For Demolition
- The Chicago Monuments Project reasons that the memorial reinforces stereotypes about Indigenous people while “glorif[ying] a complicated and painful history of Western expansion” through its portrayal of “a cowering Indian American, following submissively in the footsteps of Marquette.”
- [“Chicago Monuments Project: Recommendations for the Current and Future Collection,” (August 2022): pg 43.] (https://www.chicago.gov/content/dam/city/depts/dca/cmp/cmpreport.pdf)
- Others see the statue as “your run-of-the-mill colonialist monument” that depicts a “subservient” Indigenous person who is “happily helping” Marquette and Jolliet.
