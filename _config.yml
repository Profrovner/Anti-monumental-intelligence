title: "Anti-Monumental Intelligence: Exploring a Series of Counter-Monuments to Chicago's Contentious Public History Narratives using Generative-ai"
email: mrovner@lakeforest.edu
description: "Anti-Monumental" works with AI to critically evaluate Chicago’s public history
monuments, and to propose corrective augmentations or new models that better
represent the complicated history of race, conquest, and representation in Chicago. The
project responds to the city’s commission – the “racial healing and reckoning project”
– tasked with evaluating over 500 Chicago monuments. Though seemingly singular,
each monument is entangled in complicated and far-reaching histories of exploitation,
extraction, and displacement – histories without physical commemoration in the
contemporary city. In conversation with an LLM, the project begins to unravel the
histories underpinning monuments central to Chicago’s public narrative, to analyze the
contemporary public discourse surrounding their preservation or plans for removal,
and to connect them to alternative histories of being and belonging. The project
experiments with generative AI’s capacity for reading images, through DALL-E, for
example, to question identified monuments, and to re-envision them as “antimonuments” to Chicago’s diverse, complicated, difficult, and hidden histories.
