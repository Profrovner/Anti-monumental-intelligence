#### Anti-Monumental Intelligence

#### A series of speculative counter-narratives challenging the racism, hegemony, imperialism, and coloniality of Chicago’s controversial public history monuments

“(Anti)Monumental Intelligence” examines the historical narrative and contemporary discourse surrounding Chicago’s public monuments and memorials using AI. Following the Chicago Monument Project and the city commissioned “racial healing and reckoning project” tasked with evaluating over 500 monuments throughout the city, the project explores key sites of Chicago’s public history that are enmeshed with its racialized history. In conversation with generative-ai, the project explores public knowledge at the intersection of historical narrative, authoritative propaganda, and social media. Anti-Monumental Intelligence works with LLM to construct a map of key sites, and to thicken the public understanding of these sites and their markers with text and media surrounding their larger historical, cultural, and spatial contexts. Sites of study include those selected for public discussion by the Chicago Monuments Project, including the monument to the Fort Dearborn Massacre (1893), The Republic (1918), a replica of the 1893 original for the World’s Columbian Exhibition, the Christopher Columbus Monument (1892), and the Italo Balbo Monument (1934). Through a critical analysis of the language surrounding these public history sites, a more complicated picture is presented than that provided by the static monument, frozen in the time of its creation and accompanied by the racist rhetoric and representations of that time. Importantly, the project experiments with AI to propose and construct new models of public history that counter problematic monuments and elevate Chicago's diverse cultures and communities underrepresented in the built environment.
